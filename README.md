# Onetap
An clone of the [One Tap Quest](http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/) in HTML5,
created for the Fall 2016 class of CIS 580 at Kansas State University.

## Compiling
The source code in the src directory is transpiled from ES6 to ES3 using Browserify and Babel.  These must first be installed on your system:

```$ npm install -g browserify```

```$ npm install babelify babelify-preset-es2015```

Once installed, you can transpile the current source with the command:

```$ browserify src/onetap.js -o onetap.js -t [ babelify --presets [ es2015 ] ]```

Remember, the browser must be refreshed to receive the changed javascript file.
